                  Transitioning from electrical engineering to a career as a
                  data analyst is a natural next step in my journey, driven by
                  my <mark>deep interest in AI</mark> and
                  <mark>problem-solving</mark>. While my foundation in
                  electrical engineering taught me the precision of working with
                  complex systems, it also ignited a curiosity about how
                  data-driven insights and AI could elevate everyday
                  experiences.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  As I worked on projects involving both hardware and software,
                  I realized the incredible value of data as a tool to optimize
                  and innovate. Data analytics provides a way to dive deeper
                  into meaningful <mark>patterns and trends</mark>, helping to
                  make informed decisions that drive tangible improvements. My
                  engineering background equips me with a unique advantage: an
                  understanding of both the technical underpinnings of systems
                  and the analytical mindset to extract and interpret valuable
                  data insights.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This transition allows me to merge my technical expertise with
                  my passion for <mark>continuous learning</mark> in the tech
                  field. I’m excited to leverage my
                  <mark>problem-solving skills</mark> and
                  <mark>analytical abilities</mark> to contribute meaningfully
                  to data-driven projects that solve real-world challenges.

                  Choosing data analysis is a purposeful and exciting step for
                  me, driven by the opportunity to
                  <mark>turn raw information into actionable insights</mark>. I
                  find immense satisfaction in uncovering hidden patterns and
                  trends within data, where every dataset feels like a
                  <mark>puzzle</mark> that, once solved, can guide impactful
                  decisions. Data analysis offers the perfect balance of

                  <br />
                  My passion for data analysis is also rooted in its
                  <mark>collaborative nature</mark>. I enjoy working in
                  cross-functional teams, where insights drawn from data can
                  inform decisions across multiple areas, from product
                  development to strategy. This role enables me to bridge gaps
                  between data and business goals, contributing to solutions
                  that create value and improve outcomes.

                  with my drive to stay current and deepen my expertise. By
                  pursuing a path in data analysis, I’m excited to make a
                  tangible difference through data-driven strategies that have a
                  real impact on business and society.

                  sparks positive change and adds fresh perspectives to any
                  endeavor. <br /><br />

                  This project is an AI-powered tool that identifies different
                  types of pets—like cats, dogs, birds, fish, hamsters, and
                  bearded dragons—from uploaded photos. Trained on thousands of
                  pet images, the model is hosted online, allowing users to
